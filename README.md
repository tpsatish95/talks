- **Abstract:** Computational epigraphy is an interdisciplinary area that combines computing and the study of ancient inscriptions. The main challenge or bottleneck faced in the field of epigraphical research is the lack of standardized corpora of the ancient scripts under study. Preparing such data from raw archaeological records, requires laborious human effort, expertise and a lot of time. Machine Learning has been used in the past to reduce human effort in epigraphical research, in problems such as classification and search for graphemic patterns. However, ML and in specific Deep Learning has not been applied yet, for the complementary task of corpus preparation. This talk will be focusing on how a deep learned pipeline architecture was designed to serve as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) engine that is capable of reading the Indus script, one of the very ancient and undeciphered inscriptions of the Harappan Civilization. This pipeline takes as input, images of the undeciphered Indus script, as found in archaeological artifacts, and returns as output a string of graphemes, suitable for inclusion in a standard corpus.

- This talk will basically be dealing with how extremely similar deep learning techniques and architecture were applied to solve two extremely polar problems concerning two completely unrelated worlds; The OCR problem for the scripts of the Indus Valley Civilisation and the Image Captioning problem in the Pokemon world.

  - **Code**: https://github.com/tpsatish95/image-captioning

- **Outline** - Points of Analogy:
  - The what, why, how (the DL architecture devised) of both problems
  - Analogy 1: (Region of Interest Extraction problem - classify Text/No-Text/Both, Pokemon/Other/Part)
    - IVC: Region Proposal + Text Region Extraction
    - PW: Pokemon Localisation
  - Analogy 2: (Classification Problem - to identify the Symbols, Actors / Actions)
    - IVC: Symbol Segmentation + Identification
    - PW: Pokemon Classification + Attack Classification
  - Analogy 3: (Sequence Generation Problem - to generate Numbers, Words)
    - IVC: Sequence of Numbers
    - PW: Attacker-Attack-Victim Sequences

- **Note:** The final slide deck will have the Indus Scripts OCR problem as the base and will be drawing analogies to the Pokemon Image Captioning problem wherever appropriate. This talk will also scratch the surface of the basic concepts like CNN, Transfer Learning and whatever is being used in both of these problems.
